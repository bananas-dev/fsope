## FSOPE

### 1. Introduction to the fsope
fsope is a platform for trading tokens on the future success of people (athletes, politicians, influencers etc) within the pre-arranged rules of the platform. You are allowed to trade tokens and win weekly payouts. You will be rewarded if any of your assets happen to be the best some week by a clear criteria.

Here is an example of how that works on a football market. You can buy a token which is connected to some exact footballer. You’ll have a chance to be rewarded if he provides attacking (for eg, goals & assists) or defensive (for eg, clean sheet) returns in the real-world matches.

A key element of our project is DAO.

There are two DAO blocks.

The first part is automatic voting for prize distribution. We created the analogue of Gauges mechanics from popular DeFi projects (curve, balancer, solend etc) but adapted it to the prize pool.

The second part is the usual voting by proposals from users.

If you have some idea how to improve the project or change anything, here’s what you need to do:

* make a proposal;

* bring some arguments in favor of your idea;

* initiate a voting.

Any number parameters and rewards’ rules could be changed only through a voting.

The project was created on Solana. We determined that Solana is the most optimal option to work with because it’s fast and cheap.

### 2. Prize Pool
#### 2.1 Overall Prize Pool

Prize pool is generated by trading tokens. 95% of the amount for payment is sent to the prize pool when you buy a token from the platform (**primary market**). There is also a fee for this deal that is sent to the prize pool when you sell a token to another player on the **secondary market**. Thus buying some asset on the platform is an analogue of buy-in in poker or fantasy sports tournaments meaning everyone will compete for the part of an overall prize pool which consists of the sum of all sales on the primary and secondary markets.

1. Weekly Prize Pool

15% of an overall prize pool raffles off every week based on results of real-world matches played. It’s like an endless tournament.

13% of an overall prize pool is sent to the markets and played out every week.

There are five markets at the moment. 4 football leagues and 1 market about crypto-influencers. At an early stage percentages of the weekly prize pool are distributed equally (5 markets, 20% for each market). But DAO participants may change this distribution by participating in automatic votes that are held on a weekly basis. Each of them is interested in distributing the most part of the prize pool to that market which assets he owns from.

#### 2.2 Jackpot Banks

There are Good Run Jackpot and Bad Run Jackpot. 2% of an overall prize pool is sent to the jackpot banks (1% for each). Every player is able to win a jackpot but he needs to complete some specific conditions to get a reward. Jackpot banks are cumulative, so a jackpot won’t be raffled off if nobody achieves the required conditions. It will accumulate until someone scores the necessary number of points.

It’s important to explain that a player has to score the necessary points **within a single game** to win a jackpot. If he plays 2 or more games within one gameweek, his points in each match will be watched separately to raffle out a jackpot.

A player has to score 20 or more fantasy points to win the Good Run Jackpot and -4 or less fantasy points to win the Bad Run Jackpot.

#### 2.3 Bonus Prizes

It is allowed to get some bonus prizes only in the football market in the current version. We’ve provided the following bonus prizes:

* nation of the week;

* bonus for player’s transfer/loan;

* bonus for player’s retirement;

* won trophy.

![Alt text](images/2.png?raw=true "Title")

**Nation of the Week**

It means all players of the selected nation will raffle off prizes between themselves. The percentage of the prize pool for this competition depends on the selected country. It ranges from **1.125%** to **3.000%** of the overall prize pool. This sum will be distributed between all token holders of this player. There’s progressive pool for the best players and progressive means the better your asset performance is the higher prize you get.

![Alt text](images/3.png?raw=true "Title")

**Bonus for player’s transfer/loan**

You will get a reward if your player is sold or sent on loan to the other league beyond the fsope coverage. But it’s important to clarify that if a player goes on loan and then transfers on a permanent deal, you will get a reward just once. The size of the reward is 1.0% of an overall prize pool for each transferred/loaned player and it will be distributed between all tokens of this player as well.

**Bonus for player’s retirement**

You will also get a reward if your player decides to end his career. The size of the reward is 3.0% of an overall prize pool for each retired player.

**Won trophy**

We’ve provided an additional reward for each player who won a trophy. This applies to all official tournaments. Every player with a trophy will get 0.3% of an overall prize pool and this sum will be distributed between all token holders.

![Alt text](images/4.png?raw=true "Title")

#### 2.4 Examples

Let’s see an example of how it works with exact numbers.

Let’s say there are 100’000 sold tokens amounting to **$1’000’000** (only primary market).

An overall prize pool will be **$950’000**.

A weekly prize pool will be **$142’500**.

**$123’500** will be sent to the markets and **$19’000** will be sent to the jackpot banks ($9’500 per Good/Bad JP).

Let’s say each market still gets 20% of the weekly prize pool for ease of understanding. Then each market will get **$24’700** for a weekly raffle.

There was **$63’450** in a Bad Run Jackpot Bank before $9’500 was sent. Now there is **$72’950** and two different players (player «A» and player «B») have scored the necessary points to win the jackpot at once.

User John has both of them at the same time.

There are **2’450** tokens of player A and **8’900** tokens of player B supplied. John has 100 tokens of player A and 500 tokens of player B. So let’s count how big his reward is.

**$72’950 / (2’450 + 8’900) = $6.4** is reward per one token

**$6.4 * (100 + 500) = $3’856.4**

**$3’856.4** is the total reward for the Bad Run Jackpot for John from his two assets.

Imagine we have England as the nation of the week this time, so the most successful English players will share 3% of an overall prize pool (3% because this nation is obviously the top-1). 3% equals **$28’500**.

So depending on the number of English players, the prize distribution with $28’500 as an overall prize will look like that.

![Alt text](images/5.png?raw=true "Title")

For instance, there were 17 English players and Player C has become the best of them. His total dividends are **$11’400** and there are 4’000 tokens supplied.

User Alex has 425.5 tokens of Player C and it means he will get **$1212.7** for his performance.

**$11’400 / 4’000 * 425.5 = $1212.7**

Player D was transferred to the league beyond the fsope coverage, so all the managers have to get a compensation bonus for that. There are 1’500 tokens of this player supplied.

**1.0% * $950’000 / 1’500 = $6.33** is reward per one token

If user Jack has 115.5 tokens for this player, he will get **$731’1** as a bonus for his transfer to the other league.



Player E has decided to end his career. There are 12’870 tokens of this player supplied.

**3.0% * $950’000 /12’870 = $2.21** is reward per one token

If user Michael has 534 tokens for this player, he will get **$1’180.1** as a bonus for his retirement.



Player G has won the national cup of his country. There are 1’502 tokens of this player supplied.

**0.3% * $950’000 / 1’502 = $1.90** is reward per one token.

If user Richard has 421 tokens for this player, he will get $800 as a bonus for winning the trophy.

### 3. Markets
#### 3.1 Football Market
##### 3.1.1 Scoring System

During the season, players will receive points based on their performances. One of the possible versions of scoring system is presented below.
But we don’t necessarily have to be limited only by sport metrics.
For instance, it’s easy to include a social criteria like changing dynamics on Twitter or Instagram (followers count increase/decrease).


![Alt text](images/6_1.png?raw=true "Title")

**Clean sheets**

A clean sheet is awarded for not conceding a goal while on the pitch and playing at least 60 minutes (excluding stoppage time).

If a player has been substituted when a goal is conceded this will not affect any clean sheet bonus.

**Red Cards**

If a player receives a red card, he will continue to be penalized for goals conceded by his team.

Red card deductions include any points deducted for yellow cards.

**Assists**

Assists are awarded to the player from the goal scoring team, who makes the final pass before a goal is scored. We will award assists to the players, according to the specified resources. We won’t track fantasy assists (for example, awarded fantasy assists to a player earning the penalty/free-kick) and rely just on official statistics.

**Full-time**

Midfielders and forwards will get 1 fantasy point if they play full matches. A player has to play 90 minutes + stoppage time to be awarded. Even if he plays 90+ minutes, his substitution in stoppage time won’t let him get 1 fantasy point for full-time.

**Penalty Save**

Penalty save by a goalkeeper doesn’t mean he actually saves the penalty. If the opponent misses the target, hits the post or crossbar without the keeper touching the ball it is classified as a penalty save.

![Alt text](images/7.png?raw=true "Title")

##### 3.1.2 Prize Distribution

The weekly prize pool of every market distributes progressively. It means 25% of the best assets on every market splitting a reward and the top 1 gets the biggest part of the prize pool.

![Alt text](images/8_1.png?raw=true "Title")

##### 3.1.3 The Timing

A tournament begins on Tuesday and lasts until Monday each week.

### 4. Athletes' tokens

1 million is the overall supply of tokens for every athlete. Starting price of each asset are determined by the IDO method (an alternative ‘auction Mango’). 5% of the overall supply of tokens for each asset are available for buying for a limited time. You decide how expensive each asset will be, because at the end of the auction the overall sum will be divided into a number of sold tokens.

For example, there are 50’000 tokens of some asset available for buying.

The auction lasts for 24 hours.

The overall fundraiser is **$500’000**. So we get the final price for this asset:

**$500’000 / 50’000 = $10**

A user who invested **$111** to this auction gets **11.1** tokens of this asset in the end.

The remaining supply of the assets (95%) is also available for buying after the auction and their prices increase on arithmetic progression. It means that each next token is more expensive than the previous. There is also a secondary market where each user can sell or buy tokens. It is bid/ask format and this market adds additional liquidity and commissions to the treasury.

If the community wants to add a new player to the platform, they can raise this question on our Discord server. It is possible to create a proposal if there are enough followers of this idea. Proposal has to include a short description of the idea and voting deadline. All token holders are able to participate in voting on time.

![Alt text](images/9.png?raw=true "Title")

### 5. DAO

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a community-led entity with no central authority. It plays such an important part in the project.

First of all, there is automatic voting for prize distribution. It’s the crucial detail of the platform, because weekly payouts (those 15% of an overall prize pool) split between markets according to voting results.

It’s obvious that every user is interested in distributing the most part of the prize pool to that market, which assets he owns from. We believe it is a good motivation for most players to have the bigger voting weight in DAO. We created the analogue of Gauges mechanics from popular DeFi projects (curve, balancer, solend etc) but adapted it to the prize pool.

![Alt text](images/10.png?raw=true "Title")

DAO participants decide everything. Creation of a new market, adding new assets, changing the commissions amount. 5% of the amount for payment goes to the treasury of the project and theoretically some part of these 5% can be distributed between DAO participants by weekly payouts for those who have staked governance tokens.

You have to lock his fsope governance tokens to be able to participate in voting. The length of the locking is chosen by user. You can select the length from 1 week to 4 years. The length determines the weight of your voice, that’s why you have to choose the longest one if you have a desire to impact the project. If you lock one governance token for 4 years, it equals you having 1 vote. And it will be 208 times smaller if you lock it for 1 week.

**1 fsope locked 1 year → 0.25 vefsope**

**1 fsope locked 2 years → 0.5 vefsope**

**1 fsope locked 4 years → 1 vefsope**

The general formula to compute the vefsop balance at any point in time is:

![Alt text](images/11.png?raw=true "Title")

**Example:** 8 fsope locked for 1 years and 4 months (with 30d/month) would give:

![Alt text](images/12.png?raw=true "Title")

You have to understand that the weight of your vote decreases permanently with time to reflect the reduction in lock time (lock expiration), down to 0 at expiration. For instance, one month after the initial lock, the previous address would have a vefsope balance of:

![Alt text](images/13.png?raw=true "Title")

Of course, you can do nothing with your locked token for the locking duration.

### 6. Transparency and storage of funds

You can always know how many tokens have supplied in all markets. The data is available «on-chain» for everyone to see, at any time from anywhere.

All funds (prize pool and treasure) go to the contract (it will be audited) and multisig. But you can always check the balance **«on-chain»** because we will let you know about all the wallets connected with the project and team in advance.

### 7. Discord Server

fsope transfers the management of the project to the community from the first day of existing.

Discord participants will compile a list of the first assets on the first markets of the platform.
